To obtain similar series with the national-level ILI data, DTW-based similarity search is performed using 80% of the data (80% of total data- training data): The following three scenarios with different settings are considered:
a) single-column ILITOTAL from state-level ILI data is compared with target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data - Top 5 similar series obtained from here are placed in line #336 of data_loader.py file.
           'kansas_new1.csv','virginia_new1.csv','pennsylvania_new1.csv','alabama_new1.csv','south_carolina_new1.csv'
b) all columns from state-level ILI data are compared with target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data - Top 5 similar series obtained from here are placed in line #336 of data_loader.py file.
          'nebraska_new1.csv','pennsylvania_new1.csv','oregon_new1.csv','alabama_new1.csv','massachusetts_new1.csv'
c) single-column TOTAL (new column generated by adding the values of ‘Negatives’ and ‘Detections’ columns from the datasets) from 7 additional respiratory diseases data with target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data - Top 5 similar series obtained from here are placed in line #336 of data_loader.py file. 
          'RSV_Nationaltrain8_sum.csv','RSV_Region_5train8_sum.csv','RSV_Region_10train8_sum.csv','RSV_Region_3train8_sum.csv','RV_EV_Nationaltrain8_sum.csv']
#The number of rows after alignemnt are 267. It was mistakenly written as 287 in the report.
