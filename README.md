To obtain similar series with the national-level ILI data, DTW-based similarity search is performed using 80% of the data (80% of total data- training data): The following three scenarios with different settings are considered:
a) single-column ILITOTAL from state-level ILI data is compared with target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data - Top 5 similar series obtained from here are placed in line # of data_loader.py file.
b) all columns from state-level ILI data are compared with
target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data.
c) single-column TOTAL (new column generated by adding
the values of ‘Negatives’ and ‘Detections’ columns from the
datasets) from 7 additional respiratory diseases data with
target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data.
These scenarios are included to assess if single or multi
columns across state-level ILI data and cross disease data
exhibit temporal similarity to national-level ILI patterns. Common
period between state-level ILI data and national-level
ILI data, and cross-disease data and national-level ILI data
is considered for alignment. Only 80% of this data is used for
similarity search process as this specific data will only be the
part of training data for PatchTST model.
