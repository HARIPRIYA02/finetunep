To obtain similar series with the national-level ILI data, DTW-based similarity search is performed using 80% of the data (80% of total data- training data): The following three scenarios with different settings are considered:
a) single-column ILITOTAL from state-level ILI data is compared with target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data - Top 5 similar series obtained from here are placed in line #336 of data_loader.py file.
b) all columns from state-level ILI data are compared with target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data - Top 5 similar series obtained from here are placed in line #336 of data_loader.py file.
c) single-column TOTAL (new column generated by adding the values of ‘Negatives’ and ‘Detections’ columns from the datasets) from 7 additional respiratory diseases data with target ‘ILITOTAL’ column from national-level ILI data - Top 5 similar series obtained from here are placed in line #336 of data_loader.py file.
